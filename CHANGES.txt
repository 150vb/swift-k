*** Added a cache around the Pegasus TC file implementation.

*** Added vdl:log as a wrapper around log4j.

*** Fixed an issue in the cleanup with the same file being
    deleted multiple times concurrently.


(01/04/07)

*** Added a simple clustering mechanism for small jobs.

*** Added a "-dryrun" argument to vdlrun. If graph generation 
    is enabled, this should produce a graph without running
	any actual jobs.
	
*** Fixed an issue with caching where a file could have
    been purged more than once

(01/01/07)

*** Modified AbstractFileMapper to expose local variables as protected

*** Added a RegularExpressionMapper to do file name conversion based on regexp

*** Added a DirectoryMapper to map a list of files from a directory as an array

*** Added a CSVMapper to map a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file into a logical structure

(12/30/06)

*** A new vdlrun that is specific to VDL2.

*** Added an error translator (based on regular expressions)
    that can be used to provide improved error messages
	
*** Added a lazy errors mode in which errors in application
    execution are aggregated and reported only once at the
	end

*** Added provenance graph generation

*** Added a control mechanism for managing remote storage
    usage
	
*** Cleanups


------------------------- 0 rc 3 ---------------------------

(12/28/06)

*** The heuristics (in CoG) used to detect if a task can ever
    run (due to constraints as opposed to temporary load 
	conditions) were broken and the issue was fixed.

(12/23/06)
------------------------- 0 rc 2 ---------------------------

*** svn copy is broken so I'm noting the revision here: 115

(12/14/06)

*** Fixed the default mapper to be concurrent_mapper

*** Added passing of tc.data profiles to the job (e.g
    user-defined environment variables, jobtype, count, etc.)

------------------------- 0 rc 1 ---------------------------
(12/07/06)

*** Added dynamic loading of the TC file

*** Added cleanup which is done at the end of the
    whole run

(12/06/06)

*** Moved to CI SVN

*** Added tests directory

(11/22/06)

*** Changed to a pure Karajan adaptive scheduler instead
    of a Pegasus site selector
	
*** Added "client-side-caching" of remote files

*** Added a basic wrapper to capture exit codes and do other
    work before and after executing the job
