Scripts
-------

1.  start_services.sh - Starts coaster services
    Usage: start_services.sh [number of services]

2.  mk_catalog.rb - Generates sites.xml files for submitting condor, coaster and
      gram2 jobs to a list of OSG jobs.  The whitelist is formatted as
      [GlueSiteUniqueID]_[GlueCEInfoHostName] per site. 
    Usage: mk_catalog.rb [whitelist] [<optional: app_name>]

3.  nqueue.rb - Submits pilot coaster jobs to a list of sites by saturating it
      queueing n-jobs at a time.
    Usage: nqueue.rb [whitelist]


Example usage
-------------

Here, an app called 'extenci' will be installed on the SPRACE site resource.

1. Create a whitelist file.  (use ../site_gen/gensites.sh )

$ cat > whitelist << EOF
SPRACE_osg-ce.sprace.org.br
EOF


2. Generate gram2 sites.xml (gt2_osg.xml) file. 
   
$ ./mk_catalog.rb whitelist extenci

# Modify to use specified portlist (from start-services)
# Note that if port changes  you will need to regen...

3. Upload worker.pl script to the site.  The setup.k script also cleans up the

#   data directory of the site.
#
# $ swift setup.k  # Modify this script - upload not needed, but cleanup still needed

4. Spawn 2 coaster services.  The first one is for PADS.
   
$ ./start_services.sh 2

# 2 is just for a test...actually need Nsites+1 services (+1 for PADS, +N for other fixed sites eg Beagle)

5. Configure the service to run in passive mode.  Any swift job that will use
   coaster_osg.xml can be used aside from the slave.swift script.

$ swift -config swift.properties -sites.file coaster_osg.xml slave.swift 

6. Request coaster jobs.  The script will request (2.5 * total_cpus) pilot jobs
   throughout the duration of the workflow
   
   Method 1: via direct condor-g

$ ./nqueue.rb whitelist

   Method 2: via swift

$ swift -config swift.properties -sites.file condor_osg.xml worker.swift


7. Run your workflow.  Here, the sleep.swift sample included in the package will
   be used.

$ swift -config swift.properties -sites.file coaster_osg.xml sleep.swift
