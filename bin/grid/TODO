BUGS TO INVESTIGATE AND/OR FILE

- why are there two logs from the coaster service: uuid-named log and swift.log????


EXTENCI APPLICATION WORK

create modft install & test file; test under fork and work

run sites gen

run tcgen

run factory  (convert factory from ruby to shell?)

run wf (one service for all w/ provider staging; one service per site)


TO RESOLVE

- how to set swift throttles to handle a varying number of coaster
workers per site?

- why did Allan set exceptions in workdir names, eg for BNL?

- how to dynamically grow/shrink pool and add/remove sites;
dynamically take coaster services in and out of service.

- settings for retry and replication


FEATURES

- Add site selection option to foreachsite

- Add test of larger/variable-size data transfer, and test of data
transfer speed

It should be easy to set the data size.

It will be a bit harder to test the data transfer *speed*,
though. That could perhaps be tested with a run against the fork
jobmanager, where we can set a bound on the expected delay
time. Otherwise the delay from the time the file staging starts to the
time the app runs is hard to determine.



CLEANUP

- Find all interim tools under swift/lab/osg and place under grid/ for
development

ENHANCEMENTS

- Find Glen's tgsites command and integrate

- incorporate gstar (would be a good Globus Online feature)
