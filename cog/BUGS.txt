BUGS AND ENHANCEMENTS LIST SORTED BY TOPIC


SETUP
=====

- the NTP tme finding routine sometimes shows a time that is
greater than one second from the local time. We have not yet
identified if this is a programming error, or if this is
normal based on the time delay of the network.

- a registration page that allows the user to register their
application to the Java CoG team would be great. The
registration is stored in the .globus directory and once
registered the registration page is not anymore shown 


JAVA 1.5
========

- In case you use JDK1.5, make sure that you use the newest 
JDK1.5.0_2

FAULT TOLLERANCE
================

- A future version of the Java CoG Kit will introduce
persistent services, that is for example the user will be
able to close the lid of his descktop or shut down the
client machine and will be able to continue working at the
last preserverd state the user checkpointed.
