The abstraction-common module is the base element of the abstractions 
framework. It contains all the interface definition. It also encapsulates 
the implementation of all the foundation elements of the abstractions 
framework (Task, TaskGraph, Handlers, Specifications, etc). Finally, it 
contains the implementation of the logic required to translate 
abstractions components (Task and TaskGraph) to and from XML.
