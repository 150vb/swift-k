DESCRIPTION
   This command simply translates the given task into an XML 
   format without actually submitting the task. The user can 
   specify the service contact for the job manager, the 
   provider, the executable, and the optional arguments. Several 
   other optional parameters control the behavior of the execution. The user can 
   execute this job as a batch job, whereby the job status will 
   not be updated on the client side. The user can also redirect the 
   job output and error to a user-supplied file, either on the 
   remote machine or on the local machine.
