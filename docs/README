Swift Documentation
===================

General principles:

 - sections and subsections are ordered from <sect1>, <sect2>, etc
 - the code is inputted as <programlisting>
 - be careful to escape in-text "<" to "&lt;"


The first time guides are built in a particular checkout, it is necessary
to place the docbook formatting stylesheets under the formatting/docbook/
directory. This can be done with a symlink if docbook is installed elsewhere.

For example, on benc's os x machine:

$ cd formatting
$ ln -s /opt/local/share/xsl/docbook-xsl/ docbook


The buildguides.sh script will build all guides. Run it with no parameters,
like this:

$ ./buildguides.sh
