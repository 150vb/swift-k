Generate the html with:
$ xsltproc formatting/custom_html.xsl userguide.xml

Generate the PDF with: (fop can be downloaded from the APACHE project)
$ fop -xsl formatting/custom_fo.xsl -xml userguide.xml -pdf userguide.pdf

IMPORTANT:
You need to modify the custom_fo.xsl because currently it uses MAC OSX file locations for FO Stylesheets
