Swift Documentation
===================

General principles:

 - sections and subsections are ordered from <sect1>, <sect2>, or using
   arbitrary depth <section> tags
 - code samples are given inside <programlisting> tags, which will cause
   syntax highlighting to happen automatically
 - user interactions / screen output are given inside <screen> tags.
 - be careful to escape in-text "<" to "&lt;"
 - there are some conventions for using id attributes at various
   places in the documents - for example, some tutorial sections use
   'tutorial.<something>'; profile entries in the user guide use
   'profile.<namespace>.<key>'. Try to keep id attributes unique across
   the entire document set.

The first time guides are built in a particular checkout, it is necessary
to place the docbook formatting stylesheets under the formatting/docbook/
directory. This can be done with a symlink if docbook is installed elsewhere.

For example, on benc's os x machine:

$ cd formatting
$ ln -s /opt/local/share/xsl/docbook-xsl/ docbook


The buildguides.sh script will build all guides. Run it with no parameters,
like this:

$ ./buildguides.sh
