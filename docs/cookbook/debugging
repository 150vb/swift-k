Debugging Swift
---------------

Swift errors are logged in several places. In case of a failed Swift run, following places
should be inspected for clues:

. Text from standard output and standard error produced by running
Swift

. The .log file from this run. It will be named script.uniqueID.log
where "script" is the name of your Swift script source file, and
uniqueID is a long unique id which starts with the date and time you ran the
swift command.

. $HOME/.globus/scripts directory on the host on which you run the Swift
command, when swift is submitting to a local scheduler (Condor, PBS, SGE,
Cobalt)

. $HOME/.globus/coasters directory on remote machines on which you are
running coasters

. $HOME/.globus/* files on remote systems accessed via Coaster providers
