	<section>
		<title>Overview</title>
		<para>
There is an under-development package of Swift log processing utilties. 
		</para>

		<para>
This code is not distributed in the main Swift release. Instead, it must be
obtained from the Swift SVN repository, in the directory
<filename>log-processing/</filename>:
<screen>
svn co https://svn.ci.uchicago.edu/svn/vdl2/log-processing
</screen>
		</para>
	</section>
	<section><title>Web page about a run</title>
		<para>
			<screen>
cd log-processing/bin
export PATH=$(pwd):$PATH
swift-plot-log /path/to/readData-20080304-0903-xgqf5nhe.log 
			</screen>
This will create a web page, report-readData-20080304-0903-xgqf5nhe
If the above command is used before a run is completed, the web page will
report information about the workflow progress so far.
		</para>

	</section>
	<section><title>CEDPS logs</title>
		<para>
The log processing tools can output transition streams in
CEDPS logging format:
			<screen>
make LOG=/path/to/readData-20080304-0903-xgqf5nhe.log clean execute.cedps
			</screen>
		</para>
	</section>
	<section><title>Event/transition channels</title>
		<para>
Various event channels are extracted from the log files and made available
as <filename>.event</filename> and <filename>.transition</filename> files.
These roughly correspond to processes within the Swift runtime environment.
		</para>
		<para>These streams are then used to provide the data for the various
output formats, such as graphs, web pages and CEDPS log format.</para>
<para>The available basic stream names are: execute, execute2, kickstart,
info, karajan, clusters, stageout,
stagein, workflow
