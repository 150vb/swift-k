Swift

Description and Overview

The Swift scripting language provides a simple, compact way to write parallel scripts that run many copies of ordinary programs concurrently in various workflow patterns, reducing the need for complex parallel programming or arcane scripting to achieve this common high-level task. Swift is very general, and is in use in domains ranging from earth systems to bioinformatics to molecular modeling.

Swiftâ€™s highly portable programming model is based on implicitly parallel functional dataflow. The same Swift script runs on multi-core computers, clusters, grids, clouds, and supercomputers, and is thus a useful tool for moving workflow computations from laptop to distributed and/or high performance systems. 

There are two versions of Swift: **Swift/K** and **Swift/T**.
