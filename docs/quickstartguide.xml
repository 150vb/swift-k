				Stable releases can be obtained from the Swift download page:

		<title>Configuring Swift</title>
		
		<para>
		
			This section describes configuration steps that need to be taken in
			order to get Swift running. Since all command line tools provided
			with Swift can be found in the <filename
			class="directory"><envar>$SWIFT_HOME</envar>/bin</filename> directory, it may
			be a good idea to add this directory to your <envar>PATH</envar>
			environment variable:
			
<programlisting>
<prompt>&gt;</prompt> <command>export</command> <envar>PATH</envar>=<filename
class="directory"><envar>$SWIFT_HOME</envar>/bin</filename>:<envar>$PATH</envar>
</programlisting>
			
			If you are installing Swift on a machine with access to a graphical
			display, you can run the <command>cog-setup</command> tool to
			configure various aspects of the environment required by Swift.

			<title>User Certificate</title>
			<para>When submitting jobs to a remote machine (rather than
				executing locally), Swift makes use of the
				<ulink
				url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/security/key-index.html">
				Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI)</ulink> for authentication
				and authorization. The requirements for this are detailed in
				the following sections. Note that GSI is not required to be
				configured for local execution (which will usually be the
				case when first starting with Swift).
            </para>
			<para>
			
				GSI requires a certificate/private key
				pair for authentication to 
				<ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit">Globus Toolkit</ulink>
				services. The certificate and private key should
				be placed into the <filename
				class="file">~/.globus/usercert.pem</filename> and <filename
				class="file">~/.globus/userkey.pem</filename> files,
				respectively.

		<sect2 id="cas">
		
			<title>Certificate Authorities Root Certificates</title>
			
			<para>
			
				The Swift client libraries are generally required to authenticate
				the services to which they connect. This process requires the
				presence on the Swift submit site of the root certificates used
				to sign the host certificates of services used. These root
				certificates need to be installed in either (or both) the
				<filename class="directory">~/.globus/certificates</filename>
				and <filename
				class="directory">/etc/grid-security/certificates</filename>
				directories. A package with the root certificates of the
				certificate authorities used in the <ulink
				url="http://www.teragrid.org">TeraGrid</ulink> can be found
				<ulink
				url="http://security.teragrid.org/TG-CAs.html">here</ulink>.

			<title>Swift Properties</title>
			
			<para>
			
				A Swift properties file (named <filename
				class="file">swift.properties</filename>) can be used to
				customize certain configuration aspects of Swift. A shared
				version of this file, <filename
				class="file"><envar>$SWIFT_HOME</envar>/etc/swift.properties</filename>
				can be used to provide installation-wide defaults. A per-user
				properties file, <filename
				class="file">~/.swift/swift.properties</filename> can be used for
				user specific settings. Swift first loads the shared
				configuration file and, if present, the user configuration file.
				Any properties not explicitly set in the user configuration file
				will be inherited from the shared configuration file. Properties
				are specified in the following format:

<programlisting>
<property>name</property>=<parameter>value</parameter>
</programlisting>

				For details about the various properties Swift accepts, please
				take a look at the <ulink
				url="http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/userguide.shtml#properties">Swift
				Properties Section</ulink> in the <ulink
				url="http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/userguide.shtml">Swift
				User Guide</ulink>.

		<title>Running Swift Examples</title>
		
		<para>
		
			The Swift examples can be found in the <filename
			class="directory">&lt;SWIFT_HOME&gt;/examples</filename> directory.
			The examples are written in the <ulink
			url="http://vds.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/languagespec.shtml">SwiftScript
			Language</ulink>, and have <filename class="file">.dtm</filename> as
			a file extension.

			The Globus Security Infrastructure, which Swift uses, works with
			limited time certificates called proxies. These proxies can be
			generated from your user certificate and private key using one of
			<command>grid-proxy-init</command> or
			<command>cog-proxy-init</command> (the latter being a Java Swing
			interface to the former).

		<para>
		
			Execution of a Swift workflow is done using the
			<command>swift</command> command, which takes the Swift
			workflow file name as an argument:
			
<programlisting>
<prompt>&gt;</prompt> <command>swift</command> <option><filename
class="file">example.dtm</filename></option>
</programlisting>

			The <ulink 		
			url="http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/userguide.shtml#options">Swift 			
			Command Options Section</ulink> in the <ulink 			
			url="http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/userguide.shtml">Swift 			
			User Guide</ulink> contains details about the various options of the
			<command>swift</command>.
		
		</para>
		
		<para> 

			Swift features the ability to re-start failed workflows based on
			restart log files. Every execution of a workflow creates a restart
			log file with a named composed of the file name of the workflow
			being executed, an invocation ID, a numeric ID, and the <filename
			class="file">.rlog</filename> extension. For example, <filename
			class="file">example.dtm</filename>, when executed, could produce
			the following restart log file: <filename
			class="file">example-ht0adgi315l61.0.rlog</filename>. Normally, if
			the workflow completes successfully, the restart log file is
			deleted. If however the workflow fails, <command>swift</command>
			allows the possibility of using the restart log file to continue the
			execution of the workflow from the last consistent point before the
			failure occurred. In order to restart a workflow from a restart log
			file, the <option>-resume <parameter><filename
			class="file">logfile</filename></parameter></option> argument can be
			used after the compiled workflow file name. Example:
			
<programlisting>
<prompt>&gt;</prompt> <command>swift</command> <option>-resume <filename
class="file">example-ht0adgi315l61.0.rlog</filename></option> <option><filename
class="file">example.dtm</filename></option>
