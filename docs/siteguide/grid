Grids, including OSG and TeraGrid
---------------------------------

Overview of running on grid sites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Get a DOEGrids cert. Then register it in the *OSG Engage VO*, and/or
map it using +gx-request+ on TeraGrid sites.

* Run +GridSetup+ to configure Swift to use the grid sites.  This tests
for correct operation and creates a "green list" of good sites.

* Prepare an installation package for the programs you want to run on
grid sites via Swift, and install that package using +foreachsite+.

* Run +swift-workers+ to start and maintain a pool of Swift workers on
each site.

* Run Swift scripts that use the grid site resources.

NOTE: This revision only supports a single-entry sites file which uses
provider staging and assumes that the necessary apps are locatable
through the same tc entries (ie either absolute or PATH-relative
paths) on all sites.

NOTE: This revision has been testing using the bin/grid code from
trunk (which gets installed into trunk's bin/ directory, and the base
swift code from the 0.93 branch.  No other configurations have been
tested at the moment.  I intend to put this code in bin/grid in 0.93,
as it should have no ill affects on other Swift usage.

Requesting Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*For OSG*: Obtain a DOEGrids certificate and register the certificate in
the OSG "Engage" VO following the procedures at:

https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Engagement/EngageNewUserGuide

[red]*FIXME*: access to OSG wiki pages may request the user to present
a certificate. Is this a problem from users without one? If so, make a
copy of the page on the Swift web.

*For TeraGrid*: Obtain a DOEGrids certifcate using the OSG ENgage
instructions above. Ask a TeraGrid PI to add you to a TeraGrid
project. Once you obtain a login and project access (via US Mail), use
gx-request to add your certificate

To run jobs using the procedures documented here you need to be logged
in to a "submit host" on which you will run Swift and other
grid-related utilities. This can be any host with the OSG client stack
or equivalent tools installed. Such hosts include the OSG Engage
submit host, and the two Swift lab servers
{bridled,communicado}.ci.uchicago.edu.

Obtain a login on engage-submit.renci.org following instructions on
the OSG URL above.

Obtain a CI login with access to the Swift lab servers by requesting
"OSG Gridlab" access at:

http://accounts.ci.uchicago.edu


Connecting to a submit host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-----
ssh yourusername@bridled.ci.uchicago.edu
ssh yourusername@communicado.ci.uchicago.edu
ssh yourusername@engage-submit.renci.org
-----

Downloading and install Swift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The current version of Swift can be downloaded from
http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/downloads/index.php.

Fetch and untar the latest release.
Then add the Swift bin/ directory to your PATH. For example:

-----
cd $HOME
wget http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/packages/swift-0.92.1.tar.gz
tar txf swift-0.92.1.tar.gz
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/swift-0.92.1/bin
-----

Set up OSG environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on your shell type, run:

-----
source /opt/osg/setup.sh
or
source /opt/osg/setup.csh
-----

Create a VOMS Grid proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-----
$ voms-proxy-init -voms Engage -valid 12:00
-----

Generating Configuration Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-----
cd $HOME
mkdir swiftgrid
cd swiftgrid
gen_gridsites
# Wait a few minutes to a few hours for Swift to validate grid sites
get_greensites >greensites
-----

You can repeatedly try the get_greensites command, which simply
concatenates all the site names that sucessfully resturned an output
file from site tests.

Installing software on OSG sites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command "foreachsite" will execute a local shell script passed to
it as an argument, on each OSG site in the Engage VO ReSS site
catalog. The user's installscript will execute on either the head node
(as a GRAM "fork" job) or on a worker node, as controlled by the
-resource option. Its syntax is:

-----
$ ./foreachsite -help
./foreachsite foreachsite [-resource fork|worker ] [-sites alt-sites-file] scriptname
$ 
-----

To install your software, create a script similar to "myapp.sh",
below, which (in this example) reads a tar file of a pre-compiled
application "myapp-2.12" and executes a test script for that
application. The test script should print some reconizable indication
of its success or failure:

-----
$ cat myinstall.sh
renice 2 -p $$
IDIR=OSG_APP/extenci/myname/myapp
mkdir -p $IDIR
cd $IDIR
wget http://my.url.edu/~mydir/myapp-2.12.tar.tgz
tar zxf myapp-2.12.tar.tgz
myapp-2.12/bin/test_myapp.sh
if [ $? = 0 ]; then
  echo INSTALL SUCCEEDED
else
  echo INSTALL FAILED
fi
$
$ foreachsite -resource fork myinstall.sh
$
$ # Wait a file here, then poll for successfully installed apps...
$
$ grep SUCCEEDED run.89/*/*.stdout
$


Starting a single coaster service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This single coaster service will service all grid sites:

start-grid-service --loglevel INFO --throttle 3.99 --jobspernode 1 \
                   >& start-grid-service.out

Starting workers on OSG sites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure that your "greensites" file is in the current working
directory.

The swiftDemand file should be set to contain the number of workers
you want to start across all OSG sites. Eventually this will be set
dynamically by watching your Swift script execute.  (Note that this
number only includes jobs started by the swift-workers factory
command, not by any workers added manually from the TeraGrid - see
below.

The condor directory must be pre-created and will be used by Condor to
return stdout and stderr files from the Condor jobs, which will
execute the wrapper script "run-workers.sh".

NOTE: this script is current built manually, and wraps around and
transports the worker.pl script. This needs to be automated.

-----
echo 250 >swiftDemand mkdir -p condor

swift-workers greensites extenci \
              http://communicado.ci.uchicago.edu:$(cat service-0.wport) \
              >& swift-workers.out &
-----

Adding workers from TeraGrid sites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The job below can be used to submit jobs to TareGrid (Ranger only at
the moment) to add more workers to the execution pool. The same
requirements hold there as for OSG sites, namely, that the app tools
listed in tc for the single execution site need to be locatable on the
TeraGrid site(s).

-----
start-ranger-service --nodes 1 --walltime 00:10:00 --project TG-DBS123456N \
                     --queue development --user tg12345 --startservice no \
                     >& start-ranger-service.out 
-----

NOTE: Change the project and user names to match your TeraGrid
parameters.

Running Swift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now that everything is in place, run Swift with the following command:

-----
export SWIFT_HEAP_MAX=6000m # Add this for very large scripts

swift -config cf.ps -tc.file tc -sites.file sites.grid-ps.xml \
      catsn.swift -n=10000 >& swift.out &
-----

You should see several new files being created, called catsn.0001.out,
catsn.0002.out, etc. Each of these files should contain the contents
of what you placed into data.txt. If this happens, your job has run
successfully on the grid sites.

More Help
~~~~~~~~~

The best place for additional help is the Swift user mailing list. You
can subscribe to this list at
http://mail.ci.uchicago.edu/mailman/listinfo/swift-user. When
submitting information, please send your sites.xml file, your tc.data,
and any Swift log files that were created during your attempt.
