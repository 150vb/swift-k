SSH-CL
------
This section describes how to use the SSH command line provider (ssh-cl) to 
connect to remote sites.

Verify you can connect to the remote site
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first step of this process is to verify that you can connect to a remote
site without being prompted for a password or passphrase.

-----
$ ssh my.site.com
-----

Typically to make this work you will need to add your SSH public key to the
$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote system.

This SSH connection must work without specifying a username on the command line.
If your username differs on your local machine and the remote machine, you will 
need to add an entry like this to your local $HOME/.ssh/config:

-----
Host my.site.com
  Hostname my.site.com
  User myusername
----

Create a sites.xml file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you have verified that you can connect without prompt to the remote machine,
you will need to create a sites.xml file that contains the host information. The
example below will assume there is no scheduler on the remote system - it simply
connects to the remote machine and runs work there.

-----
<config>
  <pool handle="mysite">
    <execution provider="coaster" jobmanager="ssh-cl:local" url="my.site.com"/>
    <profile namespace="globus" key="jobsPerNode">1</profile>
    <profile namespace="globus" key="lowOverAllocation">100</profile>
    <profile namespace="globus" key="highOverAllocation">100</profile>
    <profile namespace="karajan" key="jobThrottle">1</profile>
    <profile namespace="karajan" key="initialScore">10000</profile>
    <workdirectory>/home/username/work</workdirectory>
  </pool>
</config>
-----

NOTE: This requires that the remote site can connect back to the machine where
you are running Swift. If a firewall is configured to block incoming connections, 
this will not work correctly.

Enabling coaster provider staging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If there is a shared filesystem between the two machines, you can set this as your
work directory and skip this step. Otherwise, you will need to enable coaster provider 
staging.

To do this, add the following line to your "cf" file:
-----
use.provider.staging=true
-----

To run swift, then:
-----
swift -sites.file sites.xml -tc.file tc.data -config cf script.swift
-----
