        <title>A Swift Tutorial for Live Presentation</title>
        <abstract>
            <formalpara>
                <para>
This is an introductory tutorial on the use of Swift and its
programming language SwiftScript. It is intended for use as part of a live
tutorial with instructor-provided exercise environments, and as such probably
doesn't make much sense to attempt outside of those environments.

<sect1> <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
This tutorial is intended to introduce new users to the basics of Swift.
It is structured as a series of small exercise/examples which you can
try for yourself as you read along.
    </para>
</sect1>

<sect1> <title>Hello World</title>
    <para>
The first example program (found in the file
examples/vdsk/tutorial/q1.swift) outputs a hello world message into
a file called hello.txt.
    </para>

<programlisting>
type messagefile;

(messagefile t) greeting () {
    app {
        echo &quot;Hello, world!&quot; stdout=@filename(t);
    }
}

messagefile outfile &lt;&quot;hello.txt&quot;&gt;;

outfile = greeting();
</programlisting>

<para>We can run this program as follows:</para>

<programlisting>
cd examples/vdsk/tutorial/

swift q1.swift

Swift v0.1-dev

RunID: e1bupgygrzn12
echo started
echo completed

cat hello.txt
Hello, world!
</programlisting>

<para>The basic structure of this program is a type definition,
a procedure definition, a variable definition and
then a call to the procedure:</para>


<programlisting>
type messagefile;
</programlisting>

<para>
First we define a new type, called messagefile. Data in SwiftScript
must be typed,
whether it is stored in memory or on disk. In this example, we will use
this as the type for our output message. The ; indicates that no
internal structure is defined for the data.
</para>

<programlisting>
(messagefile t) greeting () {
    app {
        echo &quot;Hello, world!&quot; stdout=@filename(t);
    }
}
</programlisting>

<para>
Next we define a procedure called write. This procedure will write out
the &quot;hello world&quot; message to a file. The procedure takes no parameters
and outputs a messagefile.
</para>

<para>
To achieve this, it executes the unix utility 'echo' with a parameter
&quot;Hello, world!&quot; and directs the standard output into the output file.
</para>

<programlisting>
messagefile outfile &lt;&quot;hello.txt&quot;&gt;;
</programlisting>

<para>
Here we define a variable called outfile. The type of this variable is
messagefile, and we specify that the contents of this variable will
be stored on disk in a file called hello.txt
</para>

<programlisting>
outfile = greeting();
</programlisting>

<para>
Now we call the greeting procedure, with its output going to the
outfile variable and therefore to hello.txt on disk.
</para>

<para>Over the following exercises, we'll extend this simple
hello world program to demonstrate various features of Swift.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1> <title>Parameters</title>

<para>
Procedures can have parameters. Input parameters specify inputs to the
procedure and output parameters specify outputs. Our helloworld greeting
procedure already uses an output parameter, t, which indicates where the
greeting output will go. In this section, we will add an input parameter
to the greeting function.</para>
<para>
We will also encounter a new built-in data type, 'string'.
</para>
<para>The code for this section can be found in q2.swift. It can be
invoked using the swift command, with output appearing in hello2.txt:</para>

<programlisting>
swift q2.swift
</programlisting>

<para>The code changes from q1.swift are highlighted below.</para>

<programlisting>
type messagefile;

(messagefile t) greeting (string s) {
    app {
        echo s stdout=@filename(t);
    }
}

messagefile outfile &lt;&quot;hello2.txt&quot;&gt;;

outfile = greeting(&quot;hello world&quot;);
</programlisting>

<para>We have modified the signature of the greeting procedure to indicate
that it takes a single parameter, s, of type 'string'.</para>
<para>We have modified the invocation of the 'echo' utility so that it
takes the value of s as a parameter, instead of the string literal
&quot;Hello, world!&quot;.</para>
<para>We have modified the output file definition to point to a different
file on disk.</para>
<para>We have modified the invocation of greeting so that a greeting
string is supplied.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>Calling the same function with different parameters</title>
<para>Now that we can choose our greeting text, we can call the same
procedure with different parameters to generate several output files with
different greetings. The code is in q12.swift and can be run as before
using the swift command.
</para>

<programlisting>
type messagefile;

(messagefile t) greeting (string s) {
    app {
        echo s stdout=@filename(t);
    }
}

messagefile english &lt;&quot;english.txt&quot;&gt;;
messagefile french &lt;&quot;francais.txt&quot;&gt;;

english = greeting(&quot;hello&quot;);
french = greeting(&quot;bonjour&quot;);

messagefile japanese &lt;&quot;nihongo.txt&quot;&gt;;
japanese = greeting(&quot;konnichiwa&quot;);
</programlisting>

<para>Note that we can intermingle definitions of variables with invocations
of procedures.</para>
<para>When this program has been run, there should be three new files in the
working directory (english.txt, francais.txt and nihongo.txt) each containing
a greeting in a different language.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>Another procedure</title>
<para>
Now we'll define a new application procedure. This will take an image as an
in PGM format and convert it to a GIF format image file.
</para>

<para>To do this, we'll use the ImageMagick 'convert' utility.</para>

<para>First we need to modify the Transformation Catalog to define
a logical transformation for the wc utility.  The transformation
catalog can be found in var/tc.data.
There is already one entry specifying where 'echo' can
be found. Add a new line to the file, specifying where 'convert' can be found
</para>

<programlisting>
local    convert    /usr/bin/convert    INSTALLED INTEL32::LINUX null
</programlisting>

<para>For now, ignore all of the fields except the second and the third.
The second field 'convert' specifies a logical transformation name and the
third specifies the location of an executable to perform that
transformation.</para>

<para>Now that we have defined the logical transformation 'convert', we can
use it in SwiftScript:
</para>

<programlisting>
type giffile;
type pgmfile;

(giffile outgif) convert(pgmfile inpgm)
{
    app {
        convert @inpgm @outgif;
    }
}

pgmfile infile &lt;&quot;in.pgm&quot;&gt;;
giffile outfile &lt;&quot;out.gif&quot;&gt;;
</programlisting>

<para>We define new data types for files containing PGM and GIF images
(although like messagefile, we don't specify any internal structure for those
files). Then we define a 'convert' procedure which invokes the
convert utility with appropriate parameters. 
Finally, we define input and output variables of the appropriate type
and invoke convert to perform the conversion.
</para>

<para>We can use the swift command to run this program (as in the previous
exercise). After running the command, there will be a file called out.gif
which contains the swift logo, converted from its pgm source.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>More on datatypes</title>

<para>
As mentioned earlier, all data in variables and files has a datatype.  So
far, we've seen simple user-defined datatypes (pgmfile and giffile) used
as marker types.</para>

<para>It is also possible to create types with structure, like in other
programming languages.</para>

<para>
In the FMRI workflow that we will write in this exercise, we will be dealing
with input data files that consist of a three dimensional brain volume
split into two files, the image data and the header data. So our data will
always come in pairs (such as subject1.img and subject1.hdr together, or
reference.img and reference.hdr together).
</para>

<para>We can tell Swift about this pairing of files using a complex data
type.</para>

<para>First define marker types for the header and image files, as before.
</para>

<programlisting>
type imagefile;
type headerfile;
</programlisting>

<para>Now we can define a volume data type that consists of an image file
and a header file.
</para>

<programlisting>
type volume {
    imagefile img;
    headerfile hdr;
};
</programlisting>

<para>Using a complex type like this, swift can ensure that files that belong
with each other are always kept together.
</para>

</sect1>


<sect1><title>Anonymous files</title>

<para>In the previous section, the file 'q13greeting.txt' is used only to
store an intermediate result. We don't really care about which name is used
for the file, as no matter which intermediate name is used we will still
get the same word count.</para>

<para>In this case, we can omit the filename mapping part of the variable
declaration. Instead of:</para>

<programlisting>
messagefile outfile &lt;&quot;q13greeting.txt&quot;&gt;;
</programlisting>

<para>we can instead write:</para>

<programlisting>
messagefile outfile;
</programlisting>

<para>q14.swift contains the code and can be run in the usual way. After
execution, the results can be found in count14.txt</para>

<programlisting>
cat count14.txt
     3 outfile-7ad257c2-c792-4f61-a0eb-96667c62ad60
</programlisting>

<para>Observe that a generated name,
outfile-7ad257c2-c792-4f61-a0eb-96667c62ad60, was
automatically mapped to outfile.</para>

</sect1>
<sect1><title>Arrays</title>
<para>We can define arrays of values. For example, we could specify each
word in a greeting as a separate element of a string array, as seen in
q5.swift:</para>

<programlisting>
type messagefile;

(messagefile t) greeting (string s[]) {
    app {
        echo s[0] s[1] s[2] stdout=@filename(t);
    }
}

messagefile outfile &lt;&quot;q5out.txt&quot;&gt;;

string words[] = [&quot;how&quot;,&quot;are&quot;,&quot;you&quot;];

outfile = greeting(words);

</programlisting>

<para>Observe that the type of the parameter to greeting is now an
array of strings, 'string s[]', instead of a single string, 'string s',
that elements of the array can be referenced numerically, for example
s[0], and that the array is initialised using an array literal,
[&quot;how&quot;,&quot;are&quot;,&quot;you&quot;].</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>Mappers</title>

<para>A significant difference between SwiftScript and other languages is
that data can be referred to on disk through variables in a very
similar fashion to data in memory.  For example, in the above
examples we have seen a variable definition like this:</para>

<programlisting>
messagefile outfile &lt;&quot;q13greeting.txt&quot;&gt;;
</programlisting>

<para>This means that 'outfile' is a dataset variable, which is
mapped to a file on disk called 'g13greeting.txt'. This variable
can be assigned to using = in a similar fashion to an in-memory
variable.  We can say that 'outfile' is mapped onto the disk file
'q13greeting.txt' by a <firstterm>mapper</firstterm>.
</para>

<para>There are various ways of mapping in SwiftScript. Two forms have already
been seen in this tutorial. Later exercises will introduce more forms.
</para>

<para>The two forms of mapping seen so far are:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<para>
simple named mapping - the name of the file that a variable is
mapped to is explictly listed. Like this:
<programlisting>
messagefile outfile &lt;&quot;greeting.txt&quot;&gt;;
</programlisting>

This is useful when you want to explicitly name input and output
files for your program. For example, 'outfile' in exercise HELLOWORLD.

</para>

<para>
anonymous mapping - no name is specified in the source code.
A name is automatically generated for the file. This is useful
for intermediate files that are only referenced through SwiftScript,
such as 'outfile' in exercise ANONYMOUSFILE. A variable declaration
is mapped anonymously by ommitting any mapper definition, like this:

<programlisting>
messagefile outfile;
</programlisting>

</para>

</itemizedlist>

<para>Later exercises will introduce other ways of mapping from
disk files to SwiftScript variables.</para>

<para>TODO: introduce @v syntax.</para>

<para>There is no hands on exercise for this section</para>

</sect1>


<sect1><title>The regexp mapper</title>
<para>In this exercise, we introduce the <firstterm>regexp mapper</firstterm>.
This mapper transforms a string expression using a regular expression,
and uses the result of that transformation as the filename to map.</para>
<para>
q16.swift demonstrates the use of this by placing output into a file that
is based on the name of the input file: our input file is mapped
to the inputfile variable using the simple named mapper, and then
we use the regular expression mapper to map the output file. Then we
use the countwords() procedure that we defined in exercise ANOTHERPROCEDURE
to count the works in the input file and store the result in the
output file.
</para>

<para>
The important bit of q16.swift is:
<programlisting>
messagefile inputfile &lt;"q16.txt"&gt;;

countfile c &lt;regexp_mapper;source=@inputfile,match="(.*)txt",transform="\1count"&gt;;
</programlisting>
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>fixed_array_mapper</title>
<para>
The <firstterm>fixed array mapper</firstterm> maps a list of files into
an array - each element of the array is mapped into one file in the
specified directory. see q22.swift
</para>
<programlisting>
string inputNames = "one.txt two.txt three.txt";
string outputNames = "one.count two.count three.count";

messagefile inputfiles[] &lt;fixed_array_mapper;files=inputNames&gt;;
countfile outputfiles[] &lt;fixed_array_mapper;files=outputNames&gt;;

outputfiles[0] = countwords(inputfiles[0]);
outputfiles[1] = countwords(inputfiles[1]);
outputfiles[2] = countwords(inputfiles[2]);
</programlisting>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>foreach</title>
<para>SwiftScript provides a control structure, foreach, to operate
on each element of an array.</para>
<para>In this example, we will run the previous word counting example
over each file in an array without having to explicitly list the
array elements. The source code for this example is in q17.swift. The
three input files (one.txt, two.txt and three.txt) are supplied. After
you have run the workflow, you should see that there are three output
files (one.count, two.count and three.count) each containing the word
count for the corresponding input file. We combine the use of the
fixed_array_mapper and the regexp_mapper.</para>
<programlisting>
string inputNames = "one.txt two.txt three.txt";

messagefile inputfiles[] &lt;fixed_array_mapper;files=inputNames&gt;;


foreach f in inputfiles {
  countfile c &lt;regexp_mapper;source=@f,match="(.*)txt",transform="\1count"&gt;;
  c = countwords(f);
}
</programlisting>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>If</title>
<para>
Decisions can be made using 'if', in a style reminiscent of many other
languages. q20.swift contains a simple example of this. Compile and run
q20.swift and see that it outputs 'good morning'. Changing the 'morning'
variable from true to false will cause the program to output 'good
afternoon'.
</para>
</sect1>


<sect1><title>Visualising the workflow as a graph</title>

<para>
When running a workflow, its possible to generate a provenance graph at the
same time:
<programlisting>
swift -pgraph graph1.dot q1.swift
dot -ograph.png -Tpng graph1.dot
</programlisting>
which can then be viewed using your favourite image viewer.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Running on a remote site</title>

<para>As configured by default, all jobs are run locally. In the previous
examples, we've invoked 'echo' and 'wc' executables from our
SwiftScript program. These have been run on the local system
(the same computer on which you ran 'swift'). We can also make our
computations run on a remote resource.</para>

<para>WARNING: This example is necessarily more vague than previous examples,
because its requires access to remote resources. You should ensure that you
can submit a job using the globus-job-run (or globusrun-ws?) command(s).
</para>

<para>We do not need to modify any SwiftScript code to run on another resource.
Instead, we must modify another catalog, the 'site catalog'. This catalog
provides details of the location that applications will be run, with the
default settings referring to the local machine. We will modify it to
refer to a remote resource - the UC Teraport cluster. If you are not a
UC Teraport user, you should use details of a different resource that
you do have access to.
</para>

<para>The site catalog is located in etc/sites.xml and is a relatively
straightforward XML format file. We must modify each of the following
three settings: gridftp (which indicates how and where data can be
transferred to the remote resource), jobmanager (which indicates how
applications can be run on the remote resource) and workdirectory
(which indicates where working storage can be found on the
remote resource).</para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Writing a mapper</title>

<para>
This section will introduce writing a custom mapper so that Swift is able
to access data files laid out in application-specific ways.
</para>
<para>
An application-specific mapper must take the form of a Java class
that implements the org.griphyn.vdl.mapping.Mapper interface. Refer
to the javadocs for that class for specific information about each
method.
</para>
<para>
In this section, we'll develop a mapper that maps SwiftScript structures
to a set of files, with a basename specified as a mapper parameter and
an extension corresponding to the SwiftScript structure name.
</para>
<para>
To illustrate, consider the following code fragment.
</para>

<programlisting>
struct volume {
    file img;
    file hdr;
}

volume v &lt;tutorial_extension_mapper;basename=&quot;subject1&quot;&gt;;
</programlisting>

<para>
Our mapper will map the volume variable v into two files, called
"subject1.img" and "subject1.hdr" corresponding to the two elements in
the structure.
</para>

<para>
We can implement the mapper in several steps. First we must write a Java
class implementing the mapper. Then we must tell Swift about this new mapper.
</para>

<para>
Here is the Java source code for our mapper. Read it and then we will go
through the various pieces.
</para>

<programlisting>

package org.griphyn.vdl.mapping.file;

import java.io.File;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collection;

import org.griphyn.vdl.mapping.AbstractMapper;
import org.griphyn.vdl.mapping.MappingParam;
import org.griphyn.vdl.mapping.Path;

public class TutorialExtensionMapper extends AbstractMapper
{

    /** defines the single parameter to this mapper */
    public static final MappingParam PARAM_BASE = new MappingParam("base");

    public String map(Path p) {
        String basename = PARAM_BASE.getStringValue(this);
        String filename = basename + "." + p;
        System.err.println("this is the tutorial mapper, mapping path "+p+" to filename "+filename);
        return filename;
    }

    public boolean exists(Path p) {
        String fn = map(p);
        File f = new File(fn);
        return f.exists();
    }

    public Collection existing() {
        return new ArrayList();
    }


    public boolean isStatic() {
        return true;
    }
}


</programlisting>

<para>
Our mapper class, TutorialExtensionMapper, must implement the Mapper interface.
We do this by extending the AbstractMapper class, which provides
implementations for some of the Mapper methods
whilst leaving others to be implemented by the specific
mapper.
</para>

<para>
There is helper code to handle most tasks related to mapper parameters.
We need to create a MapperParam object for our single parameter, 'base'.
If we wanted more than one parameter, we would create a MapperParam
object for each parameter. We can then use the mapper parameter object
later on in the code to retrieve the value of the parameter as specified
in the SwiftScript mapper description.
</para>

<para>
The core mapping functionality appears in the map method. This method will
be called by the Swift engine whenever it needs to translate a SwiftScript
variable into a filename. It is passed a Path object, which represents
the path from the top level to the part that we want to filename for.
So when swift wants the filename for v.img in the above
usage example, it will ask the mapper for v to map the path "img" to a
filename. In our example, the mapping consists of taking the 'base'
parameter and combining it with the path to give a filename.
</para>

<para>
A few other methods need to be implemented.
</para>

<para> exists() takes a Path
and returns true if the file backing that path exists. It is implemented
in a straightforward fashion.
</para>

<para>existing() returns a Collection of Paths, listing the paths that
already exist. In the tutorial, we cheat and return an empty collection.
</para>

<para>isStatic() identifies whether mappings from this mapper are
fixed at creation time, or can change over time. For most simple
mappers, it should return true. There is more discussion in the
Mapper class javadoc.
</para>

<para>
We place the above java source file into the Swift source tree
in a file called src/org/griphyn/vdl/mapping/file/TutorialExtensionMapper.java
</para>

<para>Now we need to inform the Swift engine about the existence of this
mapper. We do that by editing the MapperFactory class definition, in
src/org/griphyn/vdl/mapping/MapperFactory.java and adding a
registerMapper call alongside the existing registerMapper calls, like this:
</para>
<programlisting>
registerMapper("tutorial_extension_mapper",
org.griphyn.vdl.mapping.file.TutorialExtensionMapper.class);
</programlisting>

<para>The first parameter is the name of the mapper that will be used
in SwiftScript mapper declarations. The second parameter is the class
that we defined above that implements the mapping behaviour.
</para>

<para>
With the mapper source file in place, and MapperFactory updated, we can
recompile Swift (see instructions elsewhere on the Swift web site) and
then write SwiftScript programs which use our new mapper.
