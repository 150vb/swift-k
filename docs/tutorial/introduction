Introduction
------------
This tutorial is intended to introduce new users to the basics of Swift.
It is structured as a series of simple exercises/examples which you can
try for yourself as you read along. After the first 'hello world'
example, there are two tracks - the language track (which introduces the SwiftScript language) and the runtime track (which introduces features of the Swift runtime environment, such as running
jobs on different computational 'sites').

For information on getting an installation of Swift running, consult the
Swift Quickstart Guide <http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/quickstartguide.php>, and
return to this document when you have successfully run the test
SwiftScript program mentioned there. _suggest_ _which_ _version_. 

There is also a Swift User's Guide
<http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/guides/userguide.php> which contains
a more detailed reference material on topics covered in this manual. All
of the programs included in this tutorial can be found in your Swift
distribution in the +examples/swift+ directory.
