Build options
-------------
See the Swift download page <http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/downloads/> for
instructions on downloading and building Swift from source. When building,
various build options can be supplied on the ant commandline. These are
summarised here:

with-provider-condor - build with CoG condor provider

with-provider-coaster - build with CoG coaster provider (see the section on
coasters). Since 0.8, coasters are always built, and this option has no effect.
			
no-supporting - produces a distribution without supporting commands such as
grid-proxy-init. This is intended for when the Swift distribution will be used
in an environment where those commands are already provided by other packages,
where the Swift package should be providing only Swift commands, and where the
presence of commands such as grid-proxy-init from the Swift distribution in the
path will mask the presence of those commands from their true distribution
package such as a Globus Toolkit package.
