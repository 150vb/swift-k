Overview
--------
Swift is a data-flow oriented coarse grained scripting language that supports
dataset typing and mapping, dataset iteration, conditional branching,
and procedural composition.

Swift programs (or workflows) are written in a language called
Swift.

Swift scripts are primarily concerned with processing (possibly large)
collections of data files, by invoking programs to do that processing. Swift
handles execution of such programs on remote sites by choosing sites, handling
the staging of input and output files to and from the chosen sites and remote
execution of programs.
