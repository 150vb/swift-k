[[runtime:library]]
The Swift Library
-----------------

The Swift runtime library consists of a collection of functions and mappers. 
There are two versions of the standard library:

Version 1:: This is currently the default library and nothing special needs to 
be done to use it. Version 1 of the library will be phased out in future 
versions of swift unless the following import statement is used:
+
[listing, swift]
----
import "stdlib.v1";
----
+
Version 2:: This is a more extensive library. It will become the default in
future versions of Swift. It can be used with the current version by importing
it explicitly:
+
[listing, swift]
----
import "stdlib.v2";
----

The mapper library is unaffected by the choice of standard library.
