# 1. Comments start with "#"
# 2. New lines are ignored. Consequently empty lines are ignored.
# 3. The regular expression is separated from the replacement by a line containing only "->"
# 4. A replacement is separated from the next regexp by a line containing only ";"
# 5. Whitespace (other than newlines) is not ignored (careful about extra spaces at the end of a line)
