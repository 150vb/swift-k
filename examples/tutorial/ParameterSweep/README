This directory contains an example of running a "parameter sweep" or
"ensemble" of N simulations or "members".

To run:

  # make sure Swift 0.93 or trunk is in your $PATH

  svn co https://svn.ci.uchicago.edu/svn/vdl2/trunk/examples/tutorial/ParameterSweep
  cd ParameterSweep

  ./sweep.sh    # Runs default sweep of 5 members with 3 common data/parameter files

  ./sweep.sh -nMembers=20 -nCommon=2 # 20  members with 2 common data/parameter files

  # Each run is executed in a new unique runNNN directory: run001, run002, ...

  # tc, sites file (local.xml), and Swift properties files (cf) are generated by sweep.sh
