DESCRIPTION

    The Java CoG kit preferd compilation process is controled by ant.	

OPTIONS

    help:
               prints out this help message

    -f buildfile.xml 
              use an alternate xml build file
                        
    dist:
               creates a distribution directory of the Java CoG
               Kit. Compiled classes from different modules will be in
               different jars. Use dist.joint to put everything into
               one jar file.

    jar:
               creates a jar file for the ${project} ${long.name}
               named ${jar.filename}
                        
    javadoc:
               creates the documentation
                        
    clean:
               removes the compiled classes
                        
    cleanall:
               removes the compiled classes including the ones in 
               the modules

    distclean:
               deletes the distribution directory

    all:
               dist and javadoc
                  
    dist.joint:
               does a dist for all modules, and puts all compiled
               classes into one jar file
                  
    eclipse.modules: 
	           creates Eclipse project files for each module in the
               modules directory. Each module can then be imported
               into Eclipse as a project. The project dependencies,
               source directories, and libraries will be automatically
               set-up
                  
    eclipse.all:
               creates one Eclipse project, in the cog directory,
               which includes all of the Java CoG Kit modules.  This
               makes it more convenient to import the CoG into Eclipse
               (since there is just one project).  However, the
               advantages of modularity are gone.
                  
    eclipse.clean:
               cleans all Eclipse related files from the CoG source
               tree. This works as a complement to eclipse.modules and
               eclipse.all. If Eclipse projects were created
               otherwise, the build directory may not be deleted.
