(02/05/2007)

*** Added two methods to FileResource to allow transfers that provide
    progress information

(01/28/2007)

*** Changed IOExceptions in file resources to IrrecoverableResourceExcepion.
    It's a sub-class of FileResourceException, it allows chaining, 
	and it is more intuitive.
	
*** Added better handling of irrecoverable prblems for caching handlers.

(12/30/2006)

*** Added FILEINFO operation to the FileOperationSpecification. It
    returns a GridFile which contains information about a file such
	as size, permissions, etc.

-------------------------------2.2----------------------------------

(11/28/2006)

*** Cleaned up file resources:
      - removed GeneralException and replaced it with FileResourceExcepion
	    and IOException (to distinguish between protocol level errors
		and communication problems)
	  - added an AbstractFileResource class and moved most of the common
	    things in the implementations there.

(10/18/2006)

*** Added a MKDIRS file operation (it creates a full directory path)

*** Asynchronously stop cached resources

(10/05/2006)

*** Cleaned up the JobSpecification interface and the implementation

(08/29/2006)

*** Merged with abstraction-examples


(07/24/2006)

*** Replaced the broken DeferredCommitHashSet.

*** Added Status.isTerminal()

-------------------------------2.1----------------------------------

(04/18/2006)

*** Added support for partial transfers

*** Removed commons-logging.jar. It was not used here

(04/06/2006)

*** Made the file resource cache timer a daemon

*** Added JobSpecification.isDelegationEnabled() and
    setDelegationEnabled(boolean)
	
*** Fixed 3rd party transfers. The file name would be appended to
    the host without the separating slash.

(11/23/2005)

*** Rewrote part of the generic transfer handler. It now covers a few more cases
    such as ssh to gridftp and back transfers. It also avoids temporary files
	when not needed
	
*** Added Task.waitFor(); it blocks until the task completes/failes/is canceled

(09/30/2005) 	Removed the old sandboxing strategy. The new one allows for 
		concurrent requests. The context class loader is changed before a call
		then restored after a call to a sandboxed class.
		
				Updated the caching file handler to always release resources
		after being done.
		
				Added the trap logic to the factory in order to detect possibly
		improper class path settings.

(09/08/2005) 	Updated the castor jar to version 0.9.6

(08/27/2005) 	Improved the Javadoc comments of the abstractions interfaces 

(08/23/2005) 	Fixed Bug: 
		http://www.cogkit.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32 

(06/24/2005) 	Updated the thirdparty file transfer logic to get proper 
		status notification on transfer COMPLETE in 
		org.globus.cog.abstraction.impl.fileTransfer.DelegatedFileTransferHandler.java

(06/08/2005) 	Added support for service attributes in service.xsd schema and
		org.globus.cog.abstraction.impl.xml package

(06/08/2005) 	Added support for JobManager abstractions in 
		org.globus.cog.abstraction.interfaces.ExecutionService.java and
                org.globus.cog.abstraction.impl.common.task.ExecutionServiceImpl.java 

(05/24/2005) 	Added support for environment variables in 
		org.globus.cog.abstraction.interfaces.JobSpecification.java and 
		org.globus.cog.abstraction.impl.common.task.JobSpecificationImpl.java 

(05/10/2005) 	Fixed the concurrent modification of the available Vector in 
		org.globus.cog.abstraction.impl.common.taskgraph.TaskGraphHandlerImpl.java

(05/03/2005)	Committed fixes for http://www.cogkit.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=90 

(05/02/2005)    Made the loadProviderProperties method in AbstractionProperties
		synchronized, so multiple parallel requests to it will work as expected.
		
(04/18/2005)	Renamed the module from "core-common" to 
		"abstraction-common"

-------------------------------2.0----------------------------------

(04/08/2005)    Updated config file deployment to not fail when individual
		files are missing, but rather copy what is available. Such behaviour
		is not intended to make it in to a release, but it's better for testing
		
(03/24/2005)  	Updated the implementation of 
		org.globus.cog.core.impl.common.task.FileOperationSpecificationImpl.java
		to make it compatible with the updated interfaces

(03/24/2005)  	Cleaned the implementation of 
		org.globus.cog.core.impl.file.TaskHandlerImpl.java
		and made it compatible with the updated interfaces 

(03/24/2005)  	Streamlined the interface definition for 
		FileOperationSpecification, FileResource, and 
 		GridFile	

-------------------------------1.0----------------------------------
