This command submits a user-specified executable for remote
execution. The user can specify the service contact for the job
manager, the provider, the executable, and the optional
arguments. Several other optional parameters control the behavior
of the execution. The user can execute this job as a batch job,
whereby the job status will not be updated on the client side. The
user can also redirect the job output and error to a user-supplied
file, either on the remote machine or on the local machine. It also allows 
long-running jobs to be checkpointed to a local file.
