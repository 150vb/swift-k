Here are few quick steps to do before running the Tcl tests:

1. Run start-coaster-service in the coasters folder to start a coaster service.
The configuration for coasters is in coaster-service.conf

2. Use the url in the sites.xml generated in the tcl examples to connect to the
coaster service

3. export the folder where the pkgIndex.tcl is present as TCLLIBPATH
    export TCLLIBPATH="cog/modules/provider-coaster-c-client/tcl"
