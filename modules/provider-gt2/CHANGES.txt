*** Cleaned up the file resource implementations

(10/18/2006)

*** Added a mkdirs implementation for the file resource

(10/09/2006)

*** Use JGlobus RSL classes to construct the RSL in a structured way. 
	This does proper quoting and possibly eliminates other errors.

(10/06/2006)

*** Use textual GRAM messages instead of the error code

(04/12/2006)

*** Limited delegation is now the default

(11/23/2005)

*** Fixed a bug regarding the current dir being GridFile.UNKNOWN instead of
    GridFile.DIRECTORY. Thanks to David Del Vecchio
	
*** Added a gridftp specific security context, which allows controlling
    dcau and protection parameters.

-------------------------------2.2----------------------------------

(08/11/2005)	Added support for MPICH-G2 job submissions and mutli-job 
		rsl in 
                org.globus.cog.abstraction.impl.execution.gt2.JobSubmissionTaskHandler.java


(06/14/2005)	Fixed the GridFTP provider to do recursive deleletes with 
		GridFTP v2.0 server.
		http://www.cogkit.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=152
-------------------------------2.1----------------------------------

(06/10/2005)	Split into new and old gridftp providers. The new one should work with
		post gt3.2 servers. The old one does not work with servers from gt4.
			
		Re-implemented isDirectory in the new gridftp file resource. The old one
		was doing a cwd to check if a file was a directory. The new one does a
		mlst(), and checks the returned file type. It's twice as fast.

(06/08/2005)    Added support for FORK and PBS JobManagers in
                org.globus.cog.abstraction.impl.execution.gt2.JobSubmissionTaskHandler.java

(05/24/2005)    Added support for environment variables in
                org.globus.cog.abstraction.impl.execution.gt2.JobSubmissionTaskHandler.java

(04/18/2005)	Renamed the module from "core-provider-gt2" to 
		"provider-gt2"
-------------------------------2.0----------------------------------

-------------------------------1.1----------------------------------
(03/29/2005)	If no IP can be figured out from CoGProperties, throw an 
		exception 

(03/24/2005)  	Updated the implementation of 
		org.globus.cog.core.impl.file.ftp.FileResourceImpl.java 
		and 
		org.globus.cog.core.impl.file.gridftp.FileResourceImpl.java 
		to make them compatible with the changes in their 
		interface

(03/17/2005)  	Updated the FTPSecurityCredentialImpl to show a dialog box 
		prompting the user to enter credentials (if null
		credentials are specified)   

-------------------------------1.0----------------------------------
