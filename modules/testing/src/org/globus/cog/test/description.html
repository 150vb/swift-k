<h1>The Testing Framework Description</h1>

<h2>1. Design:</h2>

<p>The present framework allows the user to mainly perform 5 different
tests for testing the working of the GridFTP in Java CoG Kit. They are
explained below.</p> <h3>Version Test:</h3>

<p>This test retrieves the version of a gridFTP server through a GRAM
gatekeeper. The gridFTP server and the gatekeeper must be on the same
machine in order to function properly. The test may fail</p>

<ul>
  <li> if there is no GRAM server
    installed or running properly</li>
  <li> if there is no Grid FTP server
    installed or running properly</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ping Test:</h3>

<p>This test tries to ping to a gridFTP server and established
connection if successful.It verifies if the user has an account to
access the server. The test may fail</p>

<ul>
  <li>
     mso-list:l4 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list .5in">if there is no Grid FTP server
    installed or running properly</li>
  <li> if the user does not have
    access to the server running properly</li>
  <li> if there are network problems
    connecting to the host machine</li>
</ul>

<h3>List Test:</h3>

<p>This test checks list function is supported in the gridftp It tries to
connect to the remote machine and retrive list of files from the user's home
directory. The test may fail</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li> if Ping Test already fails</li>
  <li> if the server has a file or
    directory with format not supportedby the current Java CoG Kit Package.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2Party Test:</h3>

<p>This test verifies both the client to server and server to client
file transfers.It creates a dummy file, adds some data to it and
transfers to the remote machine. It then gets back the same file. The
test may fail</p>

<ul>
  <li> if the user does not have
    proper access to the server.</li>
  <li> if the Grid FTP server version
    is not compatible with one supported by the Java CoG Kit package.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3Party Test:</h3>

<p>This test tests for third party transfer support in the machine.It
tries to transfer the file obtained from second party to itself. The
test may fail</p>

<ul>
  <li> if the user does not have
    proper access to the server.</li>
  <li> if the Grid FTP server version
    is not compatible with one supported by the Java CoG Kit package.</li>
  <li> if Grid FTP server does not
    support third party transfers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Report :</h2>

<p>The output of the tests is shown in a table format in results.html
file. Each cell in the table reports the success or failure of the
test. If it it a failure, by clicking on the link the user get the
detailed stacktrace of the place where the error occured.</p>

<h2>2. Using the Testing Framework:</h2>

<h3>Installation Instructions</h3>

<h4>1. Checkout the jglobus,ogce and ftp packages from the cvs.</h4>
<p>&gt;cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@pitcairn.mcs.anl.gov:/home/dsl/cog/CVS
login</p>
<p>Press enter for password.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p>&gt;cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@pitcairn.mcs.anl.gov:/home/dsl/cog/CVS
co jglobus</p>
<p>&gt;cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@pitcairn.mcs.anl.gov:/home/dsl/cog/CVS
co ogce</p>
<p>&gt;cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@pitcairn.mcs.anl.gov:/home/dsl/cog/CVS
co ftp</p>
<p>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<h4>2. Go to ogce directory and say</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&gt; ant dist</p>
<h3>&nbsp;Running Instructions:</h3>
<h4>&nbsp;1. Change to ogce directory.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;2. First run the Java CoG setup component to make sure your ip address</h4>
<h4>is correct and certificates are loaded</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&gt;ant -f demos.xml setup</p>
<h4>&nbsp;3. Create a proxy using the following command.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&gt;ant -f demos.xml login</p>
<h4>&nbsp;4. The names of the machines to be tested are given in a text file</h4>
<p>named &quot;machines.txt&quot; present in the ogce
directory.</p>
<p>Edit this file to add the machines you need to test.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;5. Run the test using the command.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&gt;ant -f test.xml ftp</p>
<p>&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>

<h2>3.Output:</h2>

<p>The testing framework generates the output in a file named
&quot;results.html&quot; in</p>
<p>a tabular format. The names of the machines are the rows
and the different tests</p>
<p>are the columns. Each cell indicates the test result. If a
test succeeds it prints</p>
<p>out an &quot;OK&quot; message. Otherwise it prints out
&quot;Failed&quot; message which has a hyperlink to</p>
<p>the detailed error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Note: The test may take a long time if you have many
machines to test. You can</p>
<p>open the &quot;results.html&quot; file and see the
intermediate results. Refresh the page to</p>
<p>see the latest results.</p>
