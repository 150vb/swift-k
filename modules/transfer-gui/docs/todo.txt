Todo list:
1. The GUI is based on OGCE now, we need to transfer it to Cog4 first. This task involves some interface changes.
2. merge "Generate Credential" button and "Myproxy" button into one "authentication" button. When users click it, a dialog will popup and 
   provide two options for users:
   		1) generate a proxy from local certificate;
   		2) get a short-term proxy from a Myproxy server;
   Some explanation text will help users to make a decision and prevent confusion. 
3. Add a "Advanced options" button to replace "RFT" button. Clicking that button will also popup a dialog to set RFT service address, port,
   parallel streams, TCP buffer, concurrency and whether reliable transfer is enforced or not.
