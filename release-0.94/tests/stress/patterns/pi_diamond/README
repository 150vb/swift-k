Montecarlo Method for pi
========================


random_plot.sh generates the cartesian coordinates of random points in the 1st quadrant.
The range of x and y coordinates are limited to 0 - 10^6 (both inclusive). The script
then calculates the distance of the point from the origin with 10 digit decimal precision.
It then determines whether the point lies on or withing the sector of the circle which
has the origin as its centre and the 0 - 10^6 as its radius.
Typically a single instance of the random_plot.sh script generates 10-1000 points.

analyse.sh greps the output files generated by random_plot.sh and output the total number
of points that lie within the sector of the circle descibed above and those outside it.

If the total number of random points within the circle is P_in, and the total number
of random points that exist outside the circle is P_out, then Pi can be approximated
from the following:

           Pi = ( P_in * 4 ) / ( P_in + P_out )
