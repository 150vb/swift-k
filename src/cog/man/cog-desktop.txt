SYNOPIS

              [-ns] [-np] [-es]
  
DESCRIPTION

  The Grid Desktop, also refered to as CoGTop, is a user
  centric grid workspace that functions and looks much like
  the popular Windows or KDE desktops. It bundles Grid 
  functionalities already available in the Java CoG Kit into 
  a single easy to use, persistent, and portable workspace 
  that supports several desktop patterns like drag-n-drop.  
  Additionally, we have added specialized desktop icons to 
  represent RSL specifications that can be placed on to the 
  Grid Desktop, and later droped on a job submission or a 
  job specification icon to invoke a job submission on a 
  service.  All icons are able to edit their properties
  through their properties form.

  The state of the  Grid Desktop can be saved into an XML
  file. At restart it loads from its previous state.
  
  Much like other desktop environments, the Grid Desktop also
  contains a toolbar, menu bars and internal frames.

OPTIONS

   [(-help | -h)]
      displays usage
   
   [(-file | -f) <file>]
      XML file containing Desktop Icon State. 
      NOTE: Will override any other desktop state file 
      arguments

   [(-maxwidth | -mxw) <integer>]
      Maximum width for desktop.  Used when starting desktop from 
      different resolution monitor.

   [(-maxheight | -mxh) <integer>]
      Maximum height for desktop.  Used when starting desktop from 
      different resolution monitor.
      
   [(-no-save | -ns)]
      If present, the desktop will not prompt the user 
      before closing.  This is a handy debug flag for a 
      quicker desktop exit.

   [(-no-proxy | -np)]
      Do not check for Grid Proxy on start up.
      Although, the user has the ability to regenerate 
      proxy through the desktop.

   [(-empty-state | -es)]
      By pass loading from desktop file specified in
      .globus/desktop.properties, creating an empty desktop.
      System icons such as Shell and Directory Browser are still
      loaded.
  
EXAMPLES

  1) To start the desktop from a previously saved state 
     in file mydesktop.xml and ignore the default desktop file 
     specified in .globus/desktop.properties, use the command

    ./cog-desktop -f mydesktop.xml

  2) To load a desktop that is empty, does not check for proxy 
     on startup and also does not confirm desktop exit, use the 
     command

    ./cog-desktop -ns -np -es
   
  3) To load a desktop with a specified resolution of 800 pixels
     wide and 600 pixels high.

    ./cog-desktop -maxwidth 800 -maxheight 600
   
TO DO
  
  Add Grid Command Manager checkpoint information to the desktop
  state file.  Currently it is stored in a seperate file.
