DESCRIPTION
    This command submits a user-specified executable for remote
    execution. The user can specify the service contact for the job
    manager, the provider, the executable, and the optional
    arguments. Several other optional parameters control the behavior
    of the execution. The user can execute this job as a batch job,
    whereby the job status will not be updated on the client side. The
    user can also redirect the job output and error to a user-supplied
    file, either on the remote machine or on the local machine.
