    globusrun [options] [RSL String]
    globusrun -version
    globusrun -help

DESCRIPTION
    This command is deprecated. Use cogrun or cog-job-submit.

OPTIONS
    -help | -usage
            Display help.
    -v | -version
            Display version.
    -f <rsl filename> | -file <rsl filename>
            Read RSL from the local file <rsl filename>. The RSL
            must be a single job request.
    -q | -quiet
            Quiet mode (do not print diagnostic messages)
    -o | -output-enable
            Use the GASS Server library to redirect standout output
            and standard error to globusrun. Implies -quiet.
    -s | -server
            $(GLOBUSRUN_GASS_URL) can be used to access files local
            to the submission machine via GASS. Implies 
            -output-enable and -quiet.
    -w | -write-allow
            Enable the GASS Server library and allow writing to
            GASS URLs. Implies -server and -quiet.
    -r <resource manager> | -resource-manager <resource manager>
            Submit the RSL job request to the specified resource 
            manager. A resource manager can be specified in the 
            following ways:  
             - host
             - host:port
             - host:port/service
             - host/service
             - host:/service
             - host::subject
             - host:port:subject
             - host/service:subject
             - host:/service:subject
             - host:port/service:subject
            For those resource manager contacts which omit the port, 
            service or subject field the following defaults are used:
            port = 2119
            service = jobmanager 
            subject = subject based on hostname
            This is a required argument when submitting a single RSL
            request.
    -k | -kill <job ID>
            Kill a disconnected globusrun job.
    -status <job ID>
            Print the current status of the specified job.
    -b | -batch
            Cause globusrun to terminate after the job is successfully
            submitted, without waiting for its completion. Useful 
            for batch jobs. This option cannot be used together with 
            either -server or -interactive, and is also incompatible 
            with multi-request jobs. The "handle" or job ID of the 
            submitted job will be written on stdout.
    -stop-manager <job ID>
            Cause globusrun to stop the job manager, without killing 
            the job. If the save_state RSL attribute is present, then a
            job manager can be restarted by using the restart RSL 
            attribute.
    -fulldelegation
            Perform full delegation when submitting jobs.

DIAGNOSTIC OPTIONS
    -p | -parse
            Parse and validate the RSL only. Does not submit the job 
            to a GRAM gatekeeper. Multi-requests are not supported.
    -a | -authenticate-only
            Submit a gatekeeper "ping" request only. Do not parse the
            RSL or submit the job request. Requires the 
            -resource-manger argument.
    -d | -dryrun
            Submit the RSL to the job manager as a "dryrun" test
            The request will be parsed and authenticated. The job 
            manager will execute all of the preliminary operations, 
            and stop just before the job request would be executed.

NOT SUPPORTED OPTIONS
        -n | -no-interrupt
