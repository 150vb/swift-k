*** Added connection caching and use of SSH channels, and their management
    (tailored for OpenSSH servers: 10 max concurrent unauthenticated 
    connections, and 10 max channels per connection)
    
*** Added a file resource for SSH (uses the SFTP subsystem)

*** Rewrote the execution provider to:
    - always start /bin/sh instead of the user shell
    - use the channel management scheme above

(08/20/2007)

*** Redirection updates

*** Fixed hosts.xml file creation.

*** Patched the j2ssh library to report when the server throttles connections,
    so it can be detected by tools sitting above this layer

(01/11/2006)
*** The InteractiveSSHSecurity context now accepts optional "username"
    and "privatekey" attributes, which will be pre-filled in the dialog(s)
	
*** Pressing "Cancel" will return (username: "", password: ""). It prevents
    the dialog from re-appearing after "Cancel" is pressed.
	
*** Changed the credentials dialog to if the environment is headless (it 
    seems to indicate the absence of GUI capability). In that case, use 
	a console authentication dialog. The "nogui" attribute (Boolean or String)
	can also be used, if set to Boolean.TRUE or "True" to force the console
	dialog.
