The patched classes are both in the provider jar and in 
the j2ssh jar. This isn't necessary, but it is how things
are done right now. An alternative would be to make sure 
they are in only one place. However, what must not happen
is to have different versions of the classes in the aforementioned
jar files, because it may lead to jar loading order issues.
