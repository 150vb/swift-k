 Please verify that the date on your machine is correct.
 
 Below, after the date and time, you will see an offset which indicates (in milliseconds) the difference between your clock value and the value that it is supposed to have.
 
 Pressing the "Retest" button will update the offset from a time server.
 
 We recommend that you synchronize your system clock using NTP.
