 You can either load a previous Java CoG Kit configuration, or start a new one.
 
 If the second option is selected below, it means that a default previous configuration was not found.
 
 The default configuration can usually be found in your .globus directory which is located in your home directory. The default name for the Java CoG Kit configuration file is "cog.properties".
