Changes to StressTester

New in this version:

--Can read in an old logfile and display with the --load flag
--Can make room on the graph for new points either by scaling or scrolling, controlled by the -c flag.
--User can set name of output file to use for logging with the -L flag.

Still to do:

-- Make a nice GUI instead of all these command-line flags.      
-- Clean up some parts of the code.  For instance, use CoGKit's nice ArgumentParser class instead of a big ugly list of ifs.
Allow user to set:
-- time delay between adding users
-- a different command to execute on each host (right now they are all doing bin/date)
-- numerical parameters for frequency and user functions
