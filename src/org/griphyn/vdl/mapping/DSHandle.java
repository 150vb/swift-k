 * A DSHandle has a type.

 * as a Java object through the getValue() method, however that is
 * not always the case. For example in the case of data mapped from
 * files on disk, the value of those files is inaccessible through
 * the getValue methods.
 *
 * A DSHandle may have a filename (on disk) indicating where the
 * data for this DSHandle is stored. That data is not accessible
 * through the getValue interfaces.
 *
 * A DSHandle may have descendant nodes, in the case of arrays or
 * other complex structures. Each of those descendant nodes is a
 * DSHandle.
