May need to edit sites.template.xml file if work directory contained in $WORK differs on local and remote machines
Requires auth.defaults to be set up correctly in ~/.ssh
If the default configuration is overrided, and coasters is not required, the line in the configuration file:
user.provider.staging
must be set to false, otherwise the script will fail
